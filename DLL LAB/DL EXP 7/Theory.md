# Autoencoder for Image Denoising

## Aim
To design and implement an autoencoder model that removes noise from images by learning compressed representations and reconstructing clean images.

## Theory
An **autoencoder** is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of input data in an unsupervised manner. It consists of two main parts:

1. **Encoder**: Compresses the input image into a latent representation (feature space).
2. **Decoder**: Reconstructs the image from this compressed representation.

For **image denoising**, noisy images are fed into the autoencoder, and the model is trained to output the clean version of the image.  
- **Input**: Noisy image  
- **Output**: Clean image  

The autoencoder learns to ignore the noise and capture the essential features of the image.  

### Key Concepts:
- **Convolutional Autoencoders** are widely used for denoising tasks because convolutional layers capture spatial hierarchies in image data.  
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Binary Cross-Entropy is used to minimize the difference between reconstructed and clean images.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Noise reduction in scanned documents.  
  - Preprocessing for OCR.  
  - Medical imaging (removing noise from X-rays, MRIs).

## Implementation Outline
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Load dataset (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, or custom images).  
   - Add Gaussian noise to the clean images.  
   - Normalize the pixel values to range [0, 1].  

2. **Model Design**  
   - Encoder: Convolutional + MaxPooling layers.  
   - Bottleneck (latent space).  
   - Decoder: Convolutional + UpSampling layers.  

3. **Training**  
   - Train autoencoder using noisy images as input and clean images as target.  
   - Use optimizer (`Adam`) and loss (`MSE`).  

4. **Testing**  
   - Feed noisy images into the trained autoencoder.  
   - Evaluate the reconstructed (denoised) outputs.

## Conclusion
The convolutional autoencoder successfully denoises images by learning meaningful representations of the data and reconstructing clean images from noisy inputs. This approach demonstrates the power of deep learning in handling real-world problems such as noise reduction, image restoration, and feature extraction.  
Autoencoders provide a scalable and effective method for image denoising, making them an essential tool in computer vision and AI applications.

Experiment No.: 4

Remix IDE and Metamask: Smart contract development and deployment using

Metamask and Remix.

Design and develop Crypto currency

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Experiment No.Â 4

### 1. Aim:

Remix IDE and metamask smart contracts development and deployment using
metamask and Remix.\
Design and develop cryptocurrency.

### 2. Theory:

-   We will create a simple Ethereum based cryptocurrency using Solidity
    and then use Remix and Metamask to compile, deploy, and interact
    with the smart contract.\
-   MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with
    the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum
    wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be
    used to interact with decentralized applications.\
-   MetaMask allows users to store and manage account keys, broadcast
    transactions, send and receive Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies and
    tokens, and securely connect to decentralized applications through a
    compatible web browser or the mobile app's built-in browser.

### 3. Procedure:

1.  Create a new smart contract.\
2.  Open Remix IDE in your web browser.\
3.  Click on the "+" button in the left side bar to create a new file
    for your smart contract.\
4.  Compile your smart contract.\
5.  In Solidity compiler tab on contract at the right side, click the
    compile button.\
6.  Deploy your smart contract.\
7.  Go to Remix to the Deploy and Run transactions tab section and
    select "Injected Web 3" as the environment.\
8.  Click the deploy button.\
9.  Interact with your contracts.\
10. Test in MetaMask.

### 4. Conclusion:

Thus we have successfully developed and deployed smart contracts using
Remix IDE and MetaMask.

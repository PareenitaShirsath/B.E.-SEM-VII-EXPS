# Experiment No.: 3

## Deployment and Publishing Smart Contracts on Ethereum Test Network

**Tools/Technologies:**  
Ethereum test networks (Ropsten/Goerli/Rinkeby), Web3.js/Web3.py, Truffle, Geth, Ganache

---

### ✅ 3(a) Blockchain Platform Ethereum using Geth

#### 1. Aim:
To implement and interact with the Ethereum blockchain using Geth.

#### 2. Theory:
- Ethereum allows developers to build decentralized applications and smart contracts.
- **Geth (Go Ethereum)** is a CLI client for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- It is used to run nodes, deploy contracts, and interact with the network using commands.

#### 3. Procedure:
1. Download and install Geth from GitHub.
2. Run a node using `geth --syncmode "fast"`.
3. Create an Ethereum account using `geth account new`.
4. Use Geth console to compile and deploy smart contracts.

#### 4. Conclusion:
Thus, we have successfully implemented a blockchain platform using Geth.

### ✅ 3(b) Blockchain Platform Ganache

#### 1. Aim:
To simulate a local Ethereum blockchain using Ganache.

#### 2. Theory:
- **Ganache** is a personal Ethereum blockchain emulator.
- Part of the **Truffle Suite**, used for smart contract development and testing.
- Provides a local network for rapid testing without requiring actual testnets.

#### 3. Features:
1. Local Ethereum Blockchain with test accounts
2. Control over block time and mining
3. Instant transaction confirmation
4. Easy debugging and log access

#### 4. Conclusion:
Thus, we have successfully used the Ganache platform to simulate and test smart contracts in a local Ethereum environment.

### ✅ 2(a) Creating Smart Contract using Solidity

#### 1. Aim:
To create a smart contract using Solidity and Remix IDE.

#### 2. Theory:
- Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions written in code.
- They automatically execute and enforce the terms once predefined conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
- Smart contracts are deployed and executed on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling decentralized applications (DApps).
- Written in high-level languages like Solidity, they are compiled into bytecode and executed in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

**Key Features:**
- **Automation:** Executes transactions and agreements automatically.
- **Immutability:** Once deployed, code cannot be altered.
- **Transparency:** Code and transactions are visible to all participants.
- **Digital Asset Management:** Can transfer/manage tokens and interact with other contracts.

#### 3. Working of Smart Contracts:
- **Creation:** Developer writes the contract in Solidity.
- **Deployment:** Deployed on Ethereum network using gas fees.
- **Interaction:** Users or other contracts interact by sending transactions to its address.
- **Execution:** Runs based on input and predefined logic.
- **State Change:** Transfers and balance updates are recorded on-chain.
- **Events:** Emits logs that can trigger external systems or update UIs.

#### 4. Conclusion:
Thus, we have successfully implemented a smart contract using Solidity and Remix IDE.

### ✅ 2(b) Embedding Wallet and Transaction using Solidity

#### 1. Aim:
To create and embed a wallet and transaction using Solidity.

#### 2. Theory:
- **MetaMask** is a web wallet used to manage accounts and transactions.
- Can be connected with **RSK Testnet** or Ethereum test networks.
- **Remix IDE** is an online Solidity development tool used for writing, compiling, and deploying smart contracts.

#### 3. Procedure:
1. Install and set up MetaMask extension.
2. Create MetaMask account and save password/seed.
3. Connect MetaMask to RSK Testnet.
4. Get testnet RBTC from a faucet.
5. Write and compile a contract in Remix IDE.
6. Connect MetaMask with Remix.
7. Deploy the contract using the "Injected Web3" environment.
8. Observe transactions in MetaMask and testnet block explorer.
9. Verify wallet interaction (funds, confirmations, etc.)

#### 4. Conclusion:
Thus, we have successfully embedded a MetaMask wallet and created transactions using Solidity.

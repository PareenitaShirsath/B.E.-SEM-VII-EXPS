# Experiment No. 1

## 1. Aim  
**To study cryptography in blockchain using the Merkle Root Tree.**

---

## 2. Theory  
1. The Merkle Tree stores all transactions in a block and is a fundamental part of blockchain technology.  
2. It is composed of hashes of blocks which represent all the transactions securely.  
3. It allows for efficient storage and verification of transactions.

---

## 3. Working  
1. It stores all transactions by providing a digital fingerprint of the entire set of transactions.  
2. It allows users to verify individual transactions without needing access to the entire data set.  
3. The host of the Merkle Tree is called the **root node**, and the base nodes are called **leaf nodes**.  
4. Every **leaf node** is a hash of the transaction data.  
5. Every **non-leaf node** is a hash of the concatenation of its child nodes.

---

## 4. Benefits  
1. Maintains integrity and immutability of data.  
2. Helps in saving memory and improves efficiency.  
3. Acts as proof of transactions without revealing all details.

---

## 5. Conclusion  
**Thus, we have constructed and studied the working of the Merkle Root Tree, which plays a vital role in ensuring data integrity and efficient transaction verification in blockchain technology.**

## Experiment No.Â 7

### 1. Aim:

Study the Solana blockchain platform and its application in solving
blockchain challenges.

### 2. Theory:

**Overview:**\
Solana, introduced by Anatoly Yakovenko in 2020, aims to tackle the
blockchain trilemma of scalability, security, and decentralization. It
utilizes a novel consensus mechanism called Proof of History (PoH),
along with Proof of Stake (PoS).

### 3. Key Features:

-   **Proof of History (PoH):** Functions as a decentralized clock,
    enabling faster transaction processing and improved scalability.\
-   **Performance:** Can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second
    (TPS) with sub-second finality.\
-   **Native Cryptocurrency (SOL):** Used for staking and transaction
    fees.\
-   **Support for dApps and Smart Contracts:** Excels in decentralized
    finance (DeFi) and NFT development.

**Notable Projects:**\
- Serum: A decentralized exchange (DEX).\
- Audius: A music streaming service.\
- Grape Protocol: A social networking platform.

### Challenges:

Despite its popularity, Solana has faced criticism for centralization
and network outages in 2021 and 2022, raising concerns about its
stability.

### Recent Developments:

-   Solana Pay: For point-of-sale transactions.\
-   Solana Mobile Stack: For Web3 mobile development.

### 4. Conclusion:

Solana offers a highly scalable and cost-effective solution,
particularly beneficial for DeFi projects like Serum, making it
competitive despite stability concerns.

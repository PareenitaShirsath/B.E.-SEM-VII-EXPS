# 📘 THEORY

## 📌 Morphological Analysis

Morphological analysis is the study of the **structure of words**. It involves breaking down words into their component **morphemes**, which are the smallest units of meaning. This analysis helps in understanding the **formation**, **structure**, and **meaning** of words.

### Key Components:
1. **Root Words**:  
   The core part of the word that carries the primary meaning.

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefixes** (e.g., *un-*)  
   - **Suffixes** (e.g., *-ly*)  
   - **Infixes**, **Circumfixes**  
   → These modify the meaning of the root.

3. **Derivational Morphemes**:  
   Change the **meaning** or **grammatical category** of the root.  
   > e.g., *happy* → *happiness*

4. **Inflectional Morphemes**:  
   Modify **tense**, **number**, **aspect**, **mood**, etc.  
   > e.g., *run* → *runs*

## 📌 Word Generation

Word generation involves creating **new words** based on existing roots and morphological patterns.

### Types of Word Generation:
1. **Derived Words**:  
   New words formed by adding **prefixes or suffixes** to a root.  
   > e.g., *happy* → *happily*

2. **Inflected Forms**:  
   Variations of a word to express different grammatical categories.  
   > e.g., *walk* → *walked*

3. **Compounds**:  
   Words formed by **combining two or more roots**.  
   > e.g., *note* + *book* → *notebook*

# 💻 Implementation

Morphological analysis and word generation can be practically implemented in Python.

### Tools:
- `nltk`: Natural Language Toolkit
- `spacy`: Industrial-strength NLP library

### 1. Morphological Analysis
Using `nltk` or `spacy`, you can:
- Analyze words
- Extract meanings
- Identify parts of speech and grammatical features

### 2. Word Generation
You can generate:
- Inflected forms by conjugation
- Derived forms by appending suffixes
- Compound words by combining root terms

# ✅ Conclusion

The Python script provided demonstrates both **morphological analysis** and **word generation** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

### Using `nltk` and `spacy`, you can:
- **Analyze Words**:  
  Extract grammatical properties and root meanings.

- **Generate New Words**:  
  Apply prefixes, suffixes, or combine roots to form new words.

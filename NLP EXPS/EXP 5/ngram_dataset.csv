sentence
The sun rises in the east
The moon shines at night
The stars twinkle in the sky
The earth revolves around the sun
The river flows towards the sea
Birds fly in the blue sky
The train runs on the railway track
The children play in the park
The cat sleeps on the mat
The dog barks at strangers

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. Below are some prominent examples of NLP applications:

## 💬 Chatbots
AI-powered systems designed to simulate human-like conversations. They use NLP to understand user queries and provide appropriate responses, often improving over time through machine learning.

## 🎙️ Voice Assistants
Tools like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant rely on NLP for speech recognition and natural language understanding to execute tasks such as:
- Setting reminders
- Making calls
- Answering questions

## 🌍 Language Translators
Applications like Google Translate use NLP techniques (such as sequence-to-sequence modeling) to convert text from one language to another.

## 🔍 Autocomplete in Search Engines

- Predict and suggest search queries based on user input
- Enhance the overall search experience

## 😃 Sentiment Analysis
Analyzes text data (e.g., social media posts or reviews) to determine the sentiment expressed by users:
- Positive
- Negative
